Visual highlighting of pages in the TYPO3 backend page tree where the current user has content editing permissions.

## Features

- **Visual Feedback**: Highlights pages with a customizable background color where the user has content editing rights
- **Permission-Aware**: Only shows highlights based on actual user permissions
- **Admin-Optimized**: Skips highlighting for admin users (who have all permissions anyway)
- **Configurable**: Customize the highlight color through extension configuration
- **Lightweight**: Minimal performance impact using TYPO3's event system

## Why This Extension?

In large TYPO3 installations with complex permission structures, editors often struggle to identify which pages they can actually edit. This extension provides instant visual feedback in the page tree, making it immediately clear where users have content editing permissions.

## Installation

### Via Composer (recommended)

```bash
composer require ithilgers/pagetree-permissions-highlight
```

### Activation

After installation, activate the extension in the Extension Manager or via CLI:

```bash
vendor/bin/typo3 extension:setup
```

## Configuration

The extension can be configured in the Extension Configuration:

1. Go to **Admin Tools > Settings > Extension Configuration**
2. Select `pagetree_permissions_highlight`
3. Configure the following options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `highlightColor` | string | `rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.1)` | Background color for pages where the user has content editing permissions. Accepts any valid CSS color value (hex, rgb, rgba, named colors). |

### Example Configuration

```php
// config/system/settings.php
'EXTENSIONS' => [
    'pagetree_permissions_highlight' => [
        'highlightColor' => 'rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.15)', // Golden highlight
    ],
],
```

## Usage

Once installed and activated, the extension works automatically:

1. Log in to the TYPO3 backend as a non-admin user
2. Open the page tree
3. Pages where you have content editing permissions are highlighted with the configured color
4. Admin users see no highlighting (as they have permissions everywhere)

## Technical Details

### Requirements

- TYPO3 12.4 or higher
- PHP 8.1 or higher

### How It Works

The extension uses TYPO3's PSR-14 event system:

- Listens to `AfterPageTreeItemsPreparedEvent`
- Checks each page for `Permission::CONTENT_EDIT` rights
- Applies background color to permitted pages
- Skips processing for admin users

### Architecture

```

└── EventListener/
    └── PageTreeItemsListener.php  # Main event listener
